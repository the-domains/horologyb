Hold on to your hats folks.  The one of a kind Patek Philippe reference 5016A grand complication --- cased in steel with a blue enamel dial -- just hammered at the Only Watch 2015 Auction in Geneva for 7,300,000 Swiss Francs ($7.259 million US), making it the most expensive wristwatch ever sold at auction.  This breaks the previous record by a large margin.  For all timepieces, this 5016A is second only to the Graves Supercomplication, a pocket watch (also made by Patek Philippe) which sold for $24 million.
