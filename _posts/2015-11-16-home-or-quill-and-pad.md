description: "Even though the Freak is a staple of avant-garde watchmaking, I am continuously impressed by the continual improvements and inventions added to it. That is why the most recent edition is the most appropriately named: it announces right there in the name - Ulysse Nardin FreakLab - that it's the wrist-sized testing lab!"
